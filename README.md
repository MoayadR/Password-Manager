# Password-Manager
Password Manager using Python - Tkinter - Custom made Encryption System - Text File Handling 

## Description:

This was made with Python3 and Tkinter for the GUI.
Pillow was used for photo handling.
The Encryption System is based on Ciphers.
This App does NOT use a database , This is pure python.
This App creates and reads from a text file called "The Vault Note.txt" to store the encrypted passwords.
The App will tell you to make your Master Password if you didn't , otherwise it will ask for the Master Password.

## Note:
I built this app when I was a First Year Student at FCAI - CU.
I have improved since then.
